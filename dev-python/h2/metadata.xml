  <longdescription>
pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2 protocol stack. It's written from the ground up to be embeddable in whatever program you choose to use, ensuring that you can speak HTTP/2 regardless of your programming paradigm.
does not provide a parsing layer, a network layer, or any rules about concurrency. Instead, it's a purely in-memory solution, defined in terms of data actions and HTTP/2 frames. This is one building block of a full Python HTTP implementation.
